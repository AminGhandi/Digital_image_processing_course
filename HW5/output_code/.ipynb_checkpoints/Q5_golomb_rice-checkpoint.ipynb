    "The Golomb-Rice compression method, also known as the Golomb coding, is a variable-length entropy coding technique used for lossless data compression. It was developed by Solomon W. Golomb and Robert F. Rice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Golomb-Rice coding is particularly suited for encoding non-negative integers with a geometric distribution of values. It finds applications in various domains such as data compression, image and video coding, and lossless audio encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Golomb-Rice coding is to divide the input data into two parts: a quotient and a remainder. The quotient represents the integer division of the input value by a chosen parameter called the divisor or the parameter of the code, while the remainder represents the remainder after the division.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode a value using Golomb-Rice coding, the remainder is encoded using a unary code, which means that it is represented by a sequence of zeros followed by a single one. The number of leading zeros in the unary code corresponds to the value of the remainder. For example, if the remainder is 3, it would be encoded as \"0001\" in unary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quotient is then encoded using a binary code, typically represented in unary format. The length of the binary code depends on the magnitude of the quotient. The parameter of the code determines how many bits are used to represent the quotient.\n",
    "\n",
    "By choosing an appropriate parameter value, Golomb-Rice coding can achieve efficient compression for data with a geometric distribution of values. However, it may not be as effective for data with other distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoding in Golomb-Rice coding involves reversing the encoding process. The unary code is read until a one is encountered, and the number of zeros before the one determines the remainder value. The binary code is then read to obtain the quotient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Golomb-Rice coding provides a simple and efficient method for compressing non-negative integer data with a geometric distribution, making it a useful technique in various compression applications."
